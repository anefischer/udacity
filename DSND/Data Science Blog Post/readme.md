# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Programm

This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Programm

## Analyzing Stack Overflow Survey Data
Every year, Stack Overflow conducts a massive survey of people on the site, covering all sorts of information like programming languages, salary, code style and various other information. In the year 2017, they amassed more than 64,000 responses fielded from 213 countries. The data is downloaded from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017

The archive has the following structure:
- Data Science Blog Post.ipynb (Ready to run Jupyter Notebook)
- Data Science Blog Post.html (HTML Print of the notebook)

To run the Jupyter notebook following libraries are required:
* Numpy: https://github.com/numpy/numpy
* Pandas: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas
* Matplotlib: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
* Seaborn: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn

## Investigations

There is this rumor that IT guys hack all night and show up late at night. Is it actually true? Is it happening all over the world? Does the contribution to Open Source projects have an impact?
* When do people start to work?
* Do the people start to work earlier in USA or Germany?
* Do people who contribute to Open Source Projects (i.e. Hack all night) start to work later?

The investigation is done according to this sheme:
* Gather Data
* Assess Data
* Clean Data
* Exploratory Analyses
* Explanatory Visualization

The results are presentet at medium blog post.
